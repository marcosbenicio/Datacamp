The `.columns` attribute of a DataFrame returns only the column labels that correspond to the regular columns, not the index.\n","\n","The reason is that the index in a Pandas DataFrame serves a different purpose than the regular columns. The index is used to identify each row in the DataFrame and to support fast lookups and alignment of data between different DataFrames. Setting a column as the index of a DataFrame allows you to access the rows based on the values in that column, rather than the default integer index."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":42,"id":"b9d889dd","metadata":{},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["'New row indexes'"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"data":{"text/plain":["Index(['Abidjan', 'Abidjan', 'Abidjan', 'Abidjan', 'Abidjan', 'Abidjan',\n","       'Abidjan', 'Abidjan', 'Abidjan', 'Abidjan',\n","       ...\n","       'Xian', 'Xian', 'Xian', 'Xian', 'Xian', 'Xian', 'Xian', 'Xian', 'Xian',\n","       'Xian'],\n","      dtype='object', name='city', length=16500)"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"data":{"text/plain":["'new columns index'"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"data":{"text/plain":["Index(['date', 'country', 'avg_temp_c'], dtype='object')"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"}],"source":["# Row index \n","display(\"New row indexes\", temperatures_ind.index)\n","\n","# Column index\n","display('new columns index', temperatures_ind.columns)"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"04484254","metadata":{},"source":["**Reset index**\n","\n","To undo the set index, we can reset the index with the method `.reset_index()`, or we can exclude permanently the index with `.reset_index(drop = True)`."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":43,"id":"12785fee","metadata":{},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["'reset index'"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>city</th>\n","      <th>date</th>\n","      <th>country</th>\n","      <th>avg_temp_c</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>Abidjan</td>\n","      <td>2000-01-01</td>\n","      <td>Côte D'Ivoire</td>\n","      <td>27.293</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>Abidjan</td>\n","      <td>2000-02-01</td>\n","      <td>Côte D'Ivoire</td>\n","      <td>27.685</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>"],"text/plain":["      city        date        country  avg_temp_c\n","0  Abidjan  2000-01-01  Côte D'Ivoire      27.293\n","1  Abidjan  2000-02-01  Côte D'Ivoire      27.685"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"data":{"text/plain":["'drop index'"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>date</th>\n","      <th>country</th>\n","      <th>avg_temp_c</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>2000-01-01</td>\n","      <td>Côte D'Ivoire</td>\n","      <td>27.293</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>2000-02-01</td>\n","      <td>Côte D'Ivoire</td>\n","      <td>27.685</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>"],"text/plain":["         date        country  avg_temp_c\n","0  2000-01-01  Côte D'Ivoire      27.293\n","1  2000-02-01  Côte D'Ivoire      27.685"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"}],"source":["# Reset the index, keeping its contents\n","display(\"reset index\",temperatures_ind.reset_index().head(2))\n","\n","# Reset the index, dropping its contents\n","display(\"drop index\",temperatures_ind.reset_index(drop = True).head(2))"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"04bb24f8","metadata":{},"source":["**Sort index values**\n","\n","The `.sort_index` method sorts the DataFrame along the index axis and returns a new DataFrame sorted by the index values.
